Title: Intro to C++ programming for R applications for Econometricians

About the speaker: Tomasz Woźniak is a Bayesian econometrician developing new econometric methods for applied macroeconomic research. He has been a specialised R user for seventeen years, and has recently joined The R Journal as an Associate Editor. He is the author of several R packages, available at https://bsvars.org/, that combine blazingly fast algorithms written in C++ with the convenience of data analysis in R. He works as a senior lecturer at the University of Melbourne, where he has an extensive research, teaching, and engagement portfolio. He is also an external collaborator at the International Labour Organization, where he develops a new forecasting system and an R package.

Description: The session will facilitate attendees in starting programming in C++ for R applications. To learn how to do that, Tomasz has read several books, tens of articles, and taken a few online courses, so you don't have to ;) The session will focus on
+ working with C++ in RStudio,
+ assuring object compatibility between C++ and R using the package Rcpp,
+ using basic algorithmic structures like loops, conditional execution, and functions,
+ using the functions written in C++ in R (it's super simple!),
+ performing linear algebra using the package RcppArmadillo, and
+ using fast random number generators.
A sequence of hands-on exercises with applications for econometricians supports all this.

Preparations: Follow the instructions from Section 1.3. by Eddelbuettel & François (2023) (https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/Rcpp/vignettes/Rcpp-FAQ.pdf). In short:
Step 1: Install a C++ compiler: for Windows: install RTools (https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/); for macOS: install Xcode Command Line Tools (https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/install-xcode-command-line-tools/) and gfortran (https://www.scivision.dev/homebrew-install-fortran-compiler/), and for Linux: install the standard development packages.
Step 2: Install the Rcpp and RcppArmadillo packages by running in R: library(Rcpp); library(RcppArmadillo)
Step 3: Check if the installation is successful. Source the file nicetry.cpp in RStudio by executing: Rcpp::sourceCpp("nicetry.cpp"). If you see a matrix with values 1, 2, and 3 in R, you're good to go for the workshop.
We apologise, but we cannot assist any further with the preparations.
